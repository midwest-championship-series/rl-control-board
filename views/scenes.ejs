<p>Scenes</p>

<!-- The date is 3/4/2021. 10:21 PM. chezy had a brilliant foken idea, aight? 
    Allow the user to upload .html files to use as scenes.
    I know what you're thinking: HOLY SHIT CHEZ! that's mfin brilliant.
    Anyways, i'll probably think of a solution to implement it later,
    and by later I mean by December 2022. -->
<div id="scene-uploader" uk-form-custom>
    <input type="file">
    <button class="uk-button uk-button-default" type="button" tabindex="-1">Select</button>
</div>

<script>
    UIkit.upload('#scene-uploader', {
        url: '/upload-scene',
        params: {
            token: getCookie("token"),
            name: "SCENE_NAME"
        },
        multiple: false,
        name: "scene",
        completeAll: function() {
            sendNotification("upload complete");
        }
    })
